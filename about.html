        <p>Welcome to My Game Development Portfolio

        About Me
        Hello! I’m Melina, an aspiring game developer and pixel artist who wants to make learning fun. With a background in teaching and a master’s degree in bioinformatics, I have a strong foundation in both education and technology.

        My Vision
        I’m passionate about creating digital learning experiences that are not only effective but also engaging and enjoyable. I love learning and trying out new things myself, and I hope to explore many creative ways to make learning, especially science, more approachable and fun.
